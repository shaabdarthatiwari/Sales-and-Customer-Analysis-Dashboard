Sales Performance Overview
The Sales Performance Overview section offers a comprehensive view of sales metrics such as revenue, units sold, and average order value. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and trend analysis enable users to track performance over time and identify growth opportunities.

Product Analysis
In the Product Analysis segment, detailed insights into product performance are provided. This includes visualizations highlighting the top-selling products, revenue contribution by product category, and price-quantity relationships. These charts help identify popular products, analyze pricing strategies and optimize inventory management.

Customer Insights
The Customer Insights section delves into customer segmentation and behavior analysis. By categorizing customers based on criteria such as purchase frequency, recency, and total purchase value, users gain a deeper understanding of customer segments. This information aids in targeted marketing, customer retention strategies, and personalized offerings.

Geographic Analysis
The Geographic Analysis segment leverages geographical data to visualize the global presence of the store. A filled map showcases the countries where the store operates, providing insights into sales distribution and market penetration. Users can explore revenue contributions by country and uncover regional patterns and opportunities.

Throughout the project, interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-through capabilities enhance user engagement and allow for customized data exploration. Users can interact with the dashboard, select specific countries, adjust timeframes, and analyze specific customer segments, empowering them to derive actionable insights tailored to their needs.

By combining data analysis techniques, DAX commands, and powerful visualizations, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging analysis of sales and customer behavior. The interactive Power BI dashboard enables users to uncover valuable insights, make informed decisions, and drive business growth in an increasingly competitive market.
